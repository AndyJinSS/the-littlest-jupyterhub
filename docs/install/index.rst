The Littlest JupyterHub (TLJH) can run on any server that is running at least
**Ubuntu 20.04** or **Debian 10**. Earlier versions of Ubuntu and Debian are not supported,
nor are other Linux distributions.
We have a bunch of tutorials to get you started.

Tutorials to create a new server from scratch on a cloud provider & run TLJH
on it. These are **recommended** if you do not have much experience setting up
servers.
